# Introduction to Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to quickly build secure and maintainable websites. It follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern and emphasizes reusability, rapid development, and the principle of **Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY)**.

## Key Features of Django
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Django comes with a powerful ORM that allows developers to interact with databases using Python code instead of SQL.
- **Admin Interface**: Django automatically generates an admin interface based on the models defined in your application.
- **Security**: Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Scalability**: Django is used by some of the largest websites in the world, including Instagram and Pinterest, demonstrating its ability to handle scale.

## Installing Django

To install Django, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install Django via pip:

```bash
pip install django
