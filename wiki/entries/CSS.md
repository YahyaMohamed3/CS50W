# Introduction to CSS

## What is CSS?

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of web pages, allowing developers to create visually engaging and consistent designs.

## Why Use CSS?

- **Separation of Content and Presentation**: CSS enables the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (styling), making it easier to maintain and update websites.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS provides tools for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Consistency**: By using CSS, developers can apply consistent styles across multiple pages, enhancing the user experience.

## CSS Syntax
